# E-commerce_Project

This GitHub repository houses a E-commerce website that combines the power of Angular for the frontend, MySQL for the database, and Python Flask for the backend. 

Angular Frontend:
  Our frontend is built using Angular, offering a seamless and interactive shopping experience with a user-friendly interface.

MySQL Database: 
   We've utilized MySQL to manage and store product information, user data, and transaction history, ensuring efficient data management.

Python Flask Backend: 
   The backend of our E-commerce website is powered by Python Flask, providing robust and secure server-side functionality for user authentication, order processing, and more.

Happy Coding :)
